Hints:
1. Remember that cipher we devised together Squeexy? The one that incorporates your affinity for linear equations???

We need to determine the algorithm used to trick the mouse.

Step to solve:
1. Get the secret cheese ciphertext

2. Ask the mouse to encrypt a cheese (Any cheese name will do)

3. From the hint given, google search and find the algorithm.
-> Matched result: Affine Cipher

4. Decode the ciphertext obtained from step 2

Enter g and the secret cheese to get the flag. (Recommend you to enter the secret cheese MANUALLY).
